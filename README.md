Timechi vim plugin
==================

Timelog & achievements for vim

**This is just a draft at experimental stage.**

The idea:
---------
1. Tracks and summarizes time of your vim sessions
2. Pauses when idle
3. Provides a simple framework for achievements based on `:he events`. Examples:

    - "Kilosave unlocked" for 1024 saves.
    - "Escapist" for 1000 insert mode lefts.

4. Choose your annoucer, i.e.:

    - http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/say.1.html
    - http://growl.info/
    - any other you like/know, if you're on Linux

Status:
-------

Requires vim +python.

This a weekend pet project of mine. Unfinished and probably ugly here & there.
I will probably take care of it someday.
